# work-day-scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day.

When a user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Past time = grey. Present = white. Future = Green. 

When the user inputs a task for an hour and clicks the "save" button, the task will be saved to their local storage and will persist when the page is reloaded.
